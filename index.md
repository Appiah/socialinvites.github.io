### THE MOST EFFICIENT APP REFERRAL SYSTEM  ###

**In the growth stage of apps, mobile games and social networks, the main goal is user acquisition as fast as possible and at the lowest possible cost.**

Social invites is an innovative and economical concept that leverages a user’s personal connections to deliver a product invite directly to the mobile phone of a potential user.

Infobip’s international connectivity enables viral growth for pennies per acquisition.

### SOCIAL INVITES ###

Social invites allow a user that is already satisfied with the product to refer it to their own network via a text message. A mobile phone address book is stocked with contacts with whom the user has developed a personal relationship.

The user chooses to share with their address book a link which takes potential new users directly to the game or app download page.

Because they are instantly redirected into the app store, they never need to browse through similar products. Since users are receiving the download link on their phone, they are ensured to be on the correct device for easy conversion.

**With [Infobip](https://infobip.com)’s library and API, social invites can be up and running quickly and with minimal effort from your development team.**
